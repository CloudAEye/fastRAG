By the way, if i lay down or sit down, my head do not spin, only when i want to move around then i feel the whole world is spinning.. And it is normal stomach discomfort at the same time? Earlier after i relieved myself, the spinning lessen so i am not sure whether its connected or coincidences.. Thank you doc!\",\n",

In this condition, the most common symptom is dizziness or giddiness, which is made worse with movements. Accompanying nausea and vomiting are common. The condition is due to problem in the ear, and improves in a few days on own. Betahistine tablets would help relieve your symptoms. Doing vestibular rehabilitation or adaptation exercises would prevent the recurrence of these symptoms. An ENT evaluation would also help. I hope it helps. Best wishes, Chat Doctor. \"\n",

      "The patient's symptoms of feeling the whole room spinning and experiencing nausea and vomiting are consistent with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). BPPV is a type of peripheral vertigo, which is caused by a problem in the inner ear. The symptoms are usually worse with movements and can be accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Betahistine tablets would help relieve your symptoms. Doing vestibular rehabilitation or adaptation exercises would prevent the recurrence of these symptoms. An ENT evaluation would also help. I hope it helps. Best wishes, Chat Doctor.\n"

      "A patient asked: I woke up this morning feeling the whole room is spinning when i was sitting down. I went to the bathroom walking unsteadily, as i tried to focus i feel nauseous. I try to vomit but it wont come out.. After taking panadol and sleep for few hours, i still feel the same.. By the way, if i lay down or sit down, my head do not spin, only when i want to move around then i feel the whole world is spinning.. And it is normal stomach discomfort at the same time? Earlier after i relieved myself, the spinning lessen so i am not sure whether its connected or coincidences.. Thank you doc! A doctor answered: Hi, Thank you for posting your query. The most likely cause for your symptoms is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), a type of peripheral vertigo. In this condition, the most common symptom is dizziness or giddiness, which is made worse with movements. Accompanying nausea and vomiting are common. The condition is due to problem in the ear, and improves in a few days on own. Betahistine tablets would help relieve your symptoms. Doing vestibular rehabilitation or adaptation exercises would prevent the recurrence of these symptoms. An ENT evaluation would also help. I hope it helps. Best wishes, Chat Doctor. \n",

I hardly drink water. im 5 7 130lbs male. Sometimes, I feel like im so full and its hard to breath , as if my lungs are full of bricks, and I have only a tiny space for air. I get tired really easy.. but I work from home.. on the computer. I don t drink or smoke . ... I am just tired of being dizzy all the time.. I don t feel myself at all and havent been for 8 moths. I do, however have alot of stress in my life as well. any help ? A doctor answered: HI. I AM Chat Doctor. I WOULD LIKE TO HELP. THE WAY TO EXCLUDE ANY MAJOR UNDERLYING MEDICAL PROBLEM IS TO VISIT YOUR FAMILY PHYSICIAN WHO CAN GIVE YOU A PROPER PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AND RUN A FEW BASIC TESTS TO EXCLUDE ANEMIA, DIABETES ETC. A AUDIOLOGICAL EVALUATION IS ALSO NECESSARY IN YOUR CASE. IF YOUR JOB IS A SEDENTARY TYPE YOU MUST ALSO RULE OUT CERVICAL SPONDYLITIS. A LITTLE MORE EXERCISE CAN ALSO HELP BOOST YOUR \"HAPPY HORMONES\" AND HELP YOU FEEL BETTER. A VISIT TO A QUALIFIED CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST CAN HELP YOU DEAL WITH YOUR PANIC ATTACKS AND STRESSORS. SINCE IT HAS BEEN 8 MONTHS IT IS NOT ADVISABLE TO IGNORE YOUR SYMPTOMS ANYMORE. TAKE CARE BYE\n",

      "A patient asked: Recently I have had two really strange turns. The first time I was watching TV and the whole world seemed to tip backwards briefly. It happened again tonight as I picked my son up from after school club. I was stood chatting to the supervisor. I rang my doctor and there are no appointments available for 2 and a half weeks. I have to ring back in the morning. In the meantime, I feel quite anxious. A doctor answered: Hi, you need to be evaluated for what you are going through. I would like to suggest you do a few simple vestibular exercises which should help you. meanwhile fix an appointment with your GP.\n",
